Chandra Sekhar mentioned that you had some concerns about my role. For clarity, I’m primarily a developer, but due to the testing team’s tight timeline (only about five days remaining) and my access to test accounts, Srinu suggested to Murali that I assist **as a tester for this release**. I’ve agreed and am happy to support however needed.  

Please let me know if you have any questions—I’d be glad to clarify. **Thank you in advance for your understanding




I apologize, Ingrid. I had already left the office by the time you sent this message yesterday







Excuse me, I would like to kindly request permission to attend this demo session as an observer. I will attentively follow the session and present my own demo afterward. Thank you for your understanding and support
